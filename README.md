# liri-node-app
This application does multiple things and all of them are done in the command line. Frist, thing it does is display the last 20 tweets from my fake twitter account when “my-tweets” is inputted after node liri.js. Second, when you input “spotify-this-song” plus a song you like in this format “a+boy+named+sue”, it will display information about the song. Next, when you input “movie-this” plus the name of a movie in the same format, it will display information about that movie in the terminal. Last if you type “do-what-it-says” it will take the data in a .txt and run that in the terminal.    

This project is useful because it gets information from twitter, Spotify, and from omdb.

To get started on this project for yourself the first thing you’ll need is to install these four packages “node-spotify-api”, “dotenv”, “request”, and “twitter”.  Then you’ll need api keys for The Twitter api, The Spotify api, and The Omdb api.  Then start making rules to have these command work on the command line.

You can get more help on this project from stack overflow.
